# [News Pocket](https://news-pocket.vercel.app/)

News Pocket is a web app made with React which allows users to scroll through the news feed and filter news by political bias or category. I use the browser Local Storage API to keep users bookmarks locally. The news feed provided by Bing News Search API.
